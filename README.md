# VideoToText

This program takes in video input from the computer and converts the image into a text file ("text.txt"). Enter a duration and size and it will constantly update the file so you can have a picture of yourself you can send in text (if you want).

I made a program to analise pictures of a font I gave it, seeing the relative brightnesses of each letter and character. It saved that as two lists, one storing the characters in brightness order the other, storing their values mapped accross 0-255. If I didn't map it, the characters only took up a small portion of the spectrum so you'd be left with a lot of white space. 

To view the text file, I recommend opening it in chrome and using ctrl/cmd - to zoom out as much as possible.
